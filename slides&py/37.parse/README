Example code for Trees, Recursion, and Natural Language by John DeNero.

	tree.py           -- Class definitions
	print_tree.py     -- Display functions
	parse.py          -- Starter file for parser
	parse_complete.py -- Completed parser
	learn.py          -- Relative frequency estimation from a treebank
	max_parse.py      -- N-best parser ranked by likelihood

To parse a Buffalo sentence:

	$ python3 -i parse_complete.py
	>>> parse('buffalo buffalo buffalo')
	(S (NP (N buffalo))
	   (VP (V buffalo)
	       (NP (N buffalo))))

To parse an arbitrary sentence:

	$ gzcat wsj.txt.gz | python3 learn.py
	$ python3 -i max_parse.py
	>>> max_parses('teacher strikes idle kids', 2)
	(S (NP (NN teacher)
	       (NNS strikes))
	   (VP (VB idle)
	       (NP (NNS kids))))
	(S (NP (NN teacher))
	   (VP (VBZ strikes)
	       (NP (JJ idle)
	           (NNS kids))))
